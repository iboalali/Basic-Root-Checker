        DISTRIBUTION\n\n
        1. Definitions.\n\n
        \"License\" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction, and distribution as
        defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.\n\n
        \"Licensor\" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by the copyright owner that
        is granting the License.\n\n
        \"Legal Entity\" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all other entities that
        control, are controlled by, or are under common control with that entity. For the purposes
        of this definition, \"control\" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
        direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership
        of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of
        such entity.\n\n
        \"You\" (or \"Your\") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity exercising permissions
        granted by this License.\n\n
        \"Source\" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications, including but not
        limited to software source code, documentation source, and configuration files.\n\n
        \"Object\" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical transformation or translation
        of a Source form, including but not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
        and conversions to other media types.\n\n
        \"Work\" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or Object form, made available
        under the License, as indicated by a copyright notice that is included in or attached to the
        work (an example is provided in the Appendix below).\n\n
        \"Derivative Works\" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form, that is based on
        (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations,
        or other modifications represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the
        purposes of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain separable
        from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative Works
        thereof.\n\n
        \"Contribution\" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original version of the
        Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is
        intentionally submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by
        an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner. For the
        purposes of this definition, \"submitted\" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written
        communication sent to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
        communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking
        systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose of discussing and
        improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
        designated in writing by the copyright owner as \"Not a Contribution.\"\n\n
        \"Contributor\" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on behalf of whom a
        Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently incorporated within the Work.\n\n
        2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each
        Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
        royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
        publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative
        Works in Source or Object form.\n\n
        3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each
        Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
        royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have
        made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license
        applies only to those patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily
        infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s) with the
        Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute patent litigation against
        any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or
        a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent
        infringement, then any patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall
        terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.\n\n
        4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works
        thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided
        that You meet the following conditions:\n\n
        \t(a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a copy of this
        License; and\n\n
        \t(b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that You changed
        the files; and\n\n
        \t(c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You distribute, all
        copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
        excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and\n\n
        \t(d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its distribution, then any
        Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of the attribution notices
        contained within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part
        of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file
        distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or documentation, if
        provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative
        Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE
        file are for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may add Your own
        attribution notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an addendum
        to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that such additional attribution notices cannot
        be construed as modifying the License.\n\n
        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide
        additional or different license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or distribution
        of Your modifications, or for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
        reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in
        this License.\n\n
        5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any
        Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall
        be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional terms or
        conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify the terms of
        any separate license agreement you may have executed with Licensor regarding such
        Contributions.\n\n
        6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
        names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as required for
        reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the Work and reproducing the
        content of the NOTICE file.\n\n
        7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law
        or agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its
        Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either
        express or implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE,
        NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely
        responsible for determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and
        assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\n\n
        8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including
        negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate
        and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You
        for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages
        of any character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use
        the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer
        failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses), even if such
        Contributor has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\n\n
        9. Accepting Warranty or
        Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may
        choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other
        liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such
        obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on
        behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each
        Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims asserted against, such
        Contributor by reason of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.\n\n
